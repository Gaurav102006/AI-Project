AI Project


1. Objectives: Built a system that uses AI to detect plant diseases from photos. It loads plant images, adjusts them for analysis, trains a model to recognize                         diseases, and can predict diseases in new images.

2. Novelty: Made the system smarter by automatically organizing messy data, simplifying images for faster processing, and creating extra training examples by                       flipping/rotating images.

3. Applications: Helps farmers catch plant diseases early, improves crop care, and could be used in farming apps to give quick disease alerts.

4. Future Scope: Could connect to field cameras, learn more plant diseases, and turn into a phone app for farmers worldwide.

5. Explanation: Clearly showed how it works - from loading pictures to testing the AI, fixing issues like too many classes or slow processing, and making accurate                      predictions.
